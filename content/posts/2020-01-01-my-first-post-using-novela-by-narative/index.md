At last week's ProductCampRTP™, Janna Bastow presented on decisions, debts, and other dilemmas (linked here). Here are a few key takeaways that I've thought about a lot over the last week:

> The timeline roadmap is a "tech debt collection pot" that is setting product teams up for failure
> Beyond tech debt, a PM should manage design debt, process debt, culture deb, and admin deb
> Trust and an understanding of incentives are critical to allow space for talking about trade-offs between product team members - and how those impact business objectives.

I highly recommend the full read, and I love the tip for managing admin debt at the end.
